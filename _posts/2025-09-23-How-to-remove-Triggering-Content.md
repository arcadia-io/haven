The internet can be a place of healing, but for people with mental health issues, it can also trigger painful memories and intensify suffering. Every day, countless people are exposed to distressing content that can worsen their mental health. By removing trauma-related material, we can create a safe and comfortable Internet.


## What Can Be Done:

- Moderation and Filtering: Platforms need to take responsibility for what’s shared. Implementing better systems to block harmful content can make a significant difference, offering a safer space for users.
- Empowering Users: Allowing people to choose what they want to see—whether that’s filtering out specific topics or keywords—gives them control over their online experience and helps avoid triggering content.
- Encouraging Thoughtful Content Creation: Content creators should be mindful of the impact their posts can have. By being more thoughtful about the topics they discuss and how they present them, they can reduce harm and offer healing content instead.
